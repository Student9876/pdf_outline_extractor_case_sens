# Approach Explanation - Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our approach implements a lightweight yet effective persona-driven document analysis system that extracts and prioritizes relevant sections based on user personas and their specific job requirements.

## Core Components

### 1. Text Extraction & Preprocessing
We leverage PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract text blocks from PDFs while preserving structural information including page numbers and bounding boxes. Each document is processed to identify meaningful text segments that could contain relevant information.

### 2. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
The system employs a multi-factor scoring mechanism:
- **Direct Keyword Matching**: Extracts keywords from job descriptions and persona definitions, scoring text blocks based on keyword frequency and relevance
- **Weighted Domain Keywords**: Maintains a curated dictionary of domain-specific terms (methodology, dataset, revenue, etc.) with assigned importance weights
- **Content Length Heuristics**: Provides scoring boosts for substantive content blocks that are more likely to contain meaningful information

### 3. Section Prioritization
The algorithm ranks extracted sections by relevance scores, ensuring the most pertinent content appears first. We implement intelligent filtering to remove noise (very short blocks, repetitive content) while preserving comprehensive coverage of relevant topics.

### 4. Subsection Analysis
For detailed analysis, the system breaks down top-ranked sections into logical subsections using natural text boundaries (paragraphs, sentence clusters). This enables granular content exploration while maintaining readability and context.

## Technical Implementation

The solution is designed for CPU-only execution with minimal resource requirements. We avoid heavy NLP models in favor of rule-based approaches combined with statistical text analysis, ensuring fast processing times while maintaining reasonable accuracy for diverse document types and personas.

## Adaptability

The system handles diverse scenarios through:
- Flexible keyword weighting that adapts to different domains
- Persona-agnostic scoring that works across academic, business, and educational contexts
- Scalable section extraction that maintains performance across varying document collections

This lightweight approach ensures reliable performance within the specified constraints while delivering meaningful, persona-relevant document insights.
